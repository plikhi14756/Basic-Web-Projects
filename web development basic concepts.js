// files and conditions which are important part of the website

// every website must have 4 files

// 1. index.html - this file will store the html code and text content which will provide a basic structure to our website

// 2. media file - this file will store the media content like images, video or audios and many other media relatedc things of the website

// 3. CSS file - this file will store the css language code that will provide style to our website

// 4. Scripting file - This file wil have the javascript code which add some dynamic functionality to tyhe website 

// important conditions for the the website to be developed and work sucessful 

// 1. All the files must be stored together under a single folder 

// 2. space should not be used to seperate file name because some webserver replace space with %20 charactor which may lead the created site link to be broken or some server treat space in a way that it seperate a single file name into two diferent filenames 

// 3. While providing name to the website only hyphen (-) symbol should be used because all webservers will treat this as word seperator and this will ensure that website will run properly and it will not lead to a broken link

// 4. While running or testing a website all these files must be connected to each other by using some HTML code
